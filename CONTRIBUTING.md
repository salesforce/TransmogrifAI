# Issues, requests & ideas

Use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/salesforce/TransmogrifAI/issues) page to submit issues, enhancement requests and discuss ideas.

# Contributing

1. **Ensure the bug/feature was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/salesforce/TransmogrifAI/issues).  If none exists, create a new issue so that other contributors can keep track of what you are trying to add/fix and offer suggestions (or let you know if there is already an effort in progress).
3. **Clone** the forked repo to your machine.
4. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
5. **Push** your work back up to your fork.
6. **Submit** a [Pull Request](https://github.com/salesforce/TransmogrifAI/pulls) against the `master` branch and refer to the issue(s) you are fixing. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep it simple and small.

> **NOTE**: Be sure to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) before making a pull request.
