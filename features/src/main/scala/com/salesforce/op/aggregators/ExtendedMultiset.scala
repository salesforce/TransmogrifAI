/**
 * Multiset with possible negative counters (so what)
 *
 * Multiset - is a generalization of the concept of a set that,
 * unlike a set, allows multiple instances of the multiset's elements.
 * For example, {a, a, b} and {a, b} are different multisets although they are the same set.
 * However, order does not matter, so {a, a, b} and {a, b, a} are the same multiset.
