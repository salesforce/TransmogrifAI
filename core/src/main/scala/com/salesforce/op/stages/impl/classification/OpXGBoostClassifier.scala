   * See below for detailed explanations.
   *
   *   - trackerImpl: Select the implementation of Rabit tracker.
   * default: "python"
   *
   * Choice between "python" or "scala". The former utilizes the Java wrapper of the
   * Python Rabit tracker (in dmlc_core), and does not support timeout settings.
   * The "scala" version removes Python components, and fully supports timeout settings.
   *
   *   - workerConnectionTimeout: the maximum wait time for all workers to connect to the tracker.
   * default: 0 millisecond (no timeout)
   *
   * The timeout value should take the time of data loading and pre-processing into account,
   * due to the lazy execution of Spark's operations. Alternatively, you may force Spark to
   * perform data transformation before calling XGBoost.train(), so that this timeout truly
   * reflects the connection delay. Set a reasonable timeout value to prevent model
   * training/testing from hanging indefinitely, possible due to network issues.
   * Note that zero timeout value means to wait indefinitely (equivalent to Duration.Inf).
   * Ignored if the tracker implementation is "python".
