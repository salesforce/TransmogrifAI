/**
 * Wraps a spark ML estimator.  This wrapper is meant for Estimators not already covered by more specific
 * wrappers such as: [[OpPredictorWrapper]].
 * Examples of estimators meant to be wrapped with OpEstimatorWrapper include MinMaxScaler, IDF, VectorIndexer,
 * CountVectorizer, QuantileDiscretizer, StandardScaler, PCA, MaxAbsScaler, Word2Vec, etc.
 * Their defining characteristic is that they output a Model which takes in one column as input and output
 * one column as a result.

 * @param estimator the estimator to wrap
 * @param uid       stage uid
 * @tparam I the type of the transformation input feature
 * @tparam O the type of the transformation output feature
 * @tparam E spark estimator to wrap
 * @tparam M spark model type returned by spark estimator wrapped
