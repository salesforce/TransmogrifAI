/**
 * Vectorizes Binary inputs where each input is transformed into 2 vector elements
 * where the first element is [1 -> true] or [0 -> false] and the second element
 * is [1 -> filled value] or [0 -> original value]. The vector representation for
 * each input is concatenated into a final vector representation.

 * Example:
 *
 * Data: Seq[(Binary, Binary)] = ((Some(false), None)) => f1, f2
 * new BinaryVectorizer().setInput(f1, f2).setFillValue(10)
 *
 * will produce
 * Array(0.0, 0.0, 10.0, 1.0)
