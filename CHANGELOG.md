Migration guide:
1. OpLogisticRegression() is in progress (evaluator needs updates)
    may use BinaryClassificationModelSelector() instead
2. Need to add .setProbabilityCol($probCol) to evaluator in workflow definition to make sure that the evaluator will get the correct probability column to do the calculation


## 3.3.1
- SanityChecker performance improvements
- Introduced `FeatureBuilder.fromDataFrame` function allowing materializing features from a DataFrame. Example usage:
```scala
case class MyClass(s: String, l: Long, label: Double)
val data: DataFrame = Seq(MyClass("blah1", 10, label = 2.0)).toDS.toDF()
val (label, Array(fs, fl)) = FeatureBuilder.fromDataFrame[RealNN](data, response = "label")
```
- Helloworld: added a minimalistic classifier based on the Titanic dataset `com.salesforce.hw.titanic.OpTitanicMini`

## 3.3.0
1. Json4s extension to serialize Joda time arguments with op stages
2. Correctly produce json for OpWorkflowRunnerConfig
3. Added SmartTextVectorizer and SmartTextMapVectorizer
4. Update OP type hierarchy image
5. Name update bug fix in `SwThreeStageBinaryEstimator`
6. Added feature type conversion shortcuts for floats
7. Smart bucketizer for numeric map values based on a Decision Tree classifier
8. Allow serializing HashAlgorithm enum in a stage argument
9. Update Model Insights to have features excluded by raw feature filter
10. Redesign DataCutter for new Cross-Validation/Train-Validation-Split
11. Allow setting log level in Sanity Checker
12. Move reference data out of OPMapVectorizerModelArgs
13. Made maps params needed for feature parity in builder + increase defaultNumOfFeatures and maxNumOfFeatures for hashing
14. Association rule confidence/support checks
    1. Added maxConfidences function to OpStatistics that calculates the max confidence per row of the contingency matrix, along with the support of that row. Refactored SanityCheckerSummary metadata so that everything coming from the same feature group (contingency matrix) are grouped together.
15. anity checker summary metadata redesign
16. Tests indicator group collapsing for sanity checker
17. Added loco record insights
18. Redesign DataBalancer
    1. (Internal optimization) With new Cross Validation, the same DataBalancer (i.e. with the same fractions) will run many times. Estimation is not necessary, hence no need to count over and over again.
19. Model selector modified in order to have cross validation and train-split validation called on it rather than running them internally.
20. Added ability to set output name on all stages
21. Allow suppressing arg parse errors
22. Modify workflow to run cv on all stages with label mixed in
    1. **New Restriction:** OpWorkflows can only contain at most 1 Model Selector, an error will be thrown otherwise.
23. Updated default for binary model selector evaluator
    1. **New Default:** Area under PR curve is default value.
24. Added FeatureBuilder.fromRow and FeatureLike.asRaw methods.
25. Added constructor parameter `stratify` in cross-validation and train-validation split for stratification.
26. Added ability to use raw feature filter to workflow.
27. Added `RawFeatureFilter` class
28. Extend Cramer's V to work with MultiPickLists
    1. Added calculation of Cramer's V on MultiPickList fields, computed from the max of all the 2x2 Cramer's V values on each individual choice of the MultiPickList. Updated methods in OpStatistics to return chi squared statistic and p value.
29. Added Prediction feature type
    1. `Prediction` is a new `NonNullable` feature type that inherits from `RealMap`. It requires at least a `prediction: Double` to be provided, otherwise the error is thrown at construction.
    2. `Prediction` can also contain the `rawPrediction: Array[Double]` and `probability: Array[Double]` values.
30. Added UID.reset and UID.count + tests
31. Modify OpParams to provide read locations for two readers in Assessor (RawFeatureFilter) stage
32. Error on null/empty in `RealNN` + make `OPVector` nullable
    1. `RealNN` now throws an exception on null/empty values at construction
    2. `OPVector` is now a nullable type
    3. Removed `OpNumeric.``map` and `OpNumber.toDouble(default)`
33. Make param settings take priority over code settings and allow setting params that do not correspond to an underlying spark param
34. Drop indices transformer
35. Bug fix in calculating max sibling correlation
36. Added Date To Unit Circle Transformer
    1. Implements a transformer of a Date or DateTime field into a cartesian coordinate representation of an extracted time period on the unit circle.

Migration guide:
1. Use `com.salesforce.op.utils.json.EnumEntrySerializer.json4s` instead of `EnumEntrySerializer.apply` for creating JSON4S formats.
2. Make sure to specify `OpParams.alternateReaderParams` when using main constructor (can default to `Map.empty`).
3. `RealNN` now can only be created from an actual Double/Long/Int value or with a default value/behavior provided:
```scala
RealNN(0.0) // ok
1.0.toRealNN // ok
Real(None).value.toRealNN(-1.0) // ok, but default value is a requirement now
Real(None).value.toRealNN(throw new RuntTimeException("RealNN cannot be empty")) // ok
Real(None).value.toRealNN // NOT ok
```
4. OP pipeline stage `operationName` was renames to `getOperationName`

## 3.2.0
- Implemented Model Insights (acessible through `model.modelInsights(feature)`)
- Better hyperpameter defaults for model selectors
- Implemented smart binning estimator for continuous variables based on a decision tree classifier (accessible through `numeric.autoBucketize(label, trackNulls)`, while regular bucketizer is available as `numeric.bucketize(trackNulls, splits, bucketLabels)`)
- Added data cutter for multiclass model selectors - creates a data splitter that will split data into training and test set filtering out any labels that don't
meet the minimum fraction cutoff or fall in the top N labels specified.
- Base64 features vectorization - that uses `detectMimeTypes` underneath, then converts the results into `PickList` and vectorizes it
- Unified vectorization behaviour between numerical maps and numerical base feature types
- Unified vectorization behaviour between text maps and text base feature types that are pivoted
- Added an option to sanity checker to remove all features descended from a parent feature (parent is direct parent before vectorization) which has derived features that meet the exclusion criteria (`sanityChecker.setRemoveFeatureGroup`)
- Renamed sampleLimit to sampleUpperLimit and added sampleLowerLimit options for sanity checker
- Collect and expose spark stage metrics - `OpSparkListener` now allows to collect and expose stage metrics and it's controlled using `OpParams.collectStageMetrics` parameter (`false` by default). The metrics are available through `OpWorkflowRunner.addApplicationEndHandler`.
- OP CLI gen: allows providing answers file, auto detecting schemas and autogeneration of avro schema from data.

Minor fixes:
- Add null tracking to `NumericBucketizer`
- Add sequence aggregator for calculating means by key of RealMaps
- Added commutative group aggregator - It is good for sliding window aggregation - can subtract expired data. As an example, ExtendedMultiset - it counts words, and can subtract. So, it also can have negative counters, for borrowed words or something.
- Fixing random phones generator: US phone numbers are now correctly generated

Migration Guide:
- `TextMapVectorizer` has been renamed to `TextMapPivotVectorizer` to make its behavior more apparent. A new `TextMapHashingVectorizer` will be released in a future version.
